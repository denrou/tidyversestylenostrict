# tidyversestylenostrict

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of tidyversestylenostrict is to provide a `tidyverse_style` function where the `strict` option is disable by default.

Why? In order to use [`precommit style-files`](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/precommit/blob/master/inst/bin/style-files) without messing with all my files already created.

## Installation

You can install the released version of tidyversestylenostrict from [github](https://github.com/denrou/tidyversestylenostrict) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("denrou/tidyversestylenostrict")
```
